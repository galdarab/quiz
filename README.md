# React + Vite
In this project, I built a quiz with 5 questions that retrieves its questions from an external API containing questions with severl difficulty levels.
Each time you move to the next question, the completion percentage increases, and if the answer is correct, the score also increases.
After answering the fifth question, the results are displayed, including the final score and an option to restart the quiz.
If you choose to restart the quiz, a new set of random questions is loaded, ensuring that questions do not repeat themselves.
